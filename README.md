User Project

This program allows you to read, create and delete users in the database system. The program initially starts with 3 users ; Anvir, Krystal, Nicole. 

As the program runs, one user is deleted and another one is created. By the end of the program, there are 3 users with the ID 1, 3, and 4.  Therefore, user 2 is deleted. # ModernWebLab2
